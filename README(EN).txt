Hi, I'm Engine999!  
I majored in Japanese and am currently preparing to enter graduate school in the field of Computer Engineering.  
I'm particularly interested in automation and system programming.  
This project was created as a personal exercise to improve my skills in system-level programming.

Project Title: Auto-Sort .cpp Files by Creation Date

Description:
This program monitors a specific folder in real-time and automatically moves newly created .cpp files into a subfolder named after today's date (e.g., 2025-03-24).
It helps organize code files based on their creation date.

Features:

Monitors a folder for newly added .cpp files

Checks whether the file was created today

Creates a new folder with today's date if not already present

Moves the file into that folder

Usage:

Compile the code on Windows using a C compiler (e.g., Visual Studio).

Modify the path in main() to the folder you want to monitor.

Run the program â€” it will keep watching the folder.

When a new .cpp file appears, it will be moved if it was created today.

Note:

Only .cpp files are processed.

This program is designed for Windows (uses windows.h and WinAPI).
